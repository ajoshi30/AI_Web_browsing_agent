ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

SmolAgents (Hugging Face) â€“ agent orchestration

OpenAI GPT-4o (configurable) â€“ reasoning engine

Selenium + Helium â€“ browser automation (navigation, clicks, scrolling)

DuckDuckGo Search Tool â€“ web search integration

PIL â€“ screenshot capture and visualization

ðŸ“‚ How it Works

Initialize a CodeAgent with tools (search, browser navigation, screenshot capture).

Use an LLM to plan actions step-by-step.

Automate browsing in Chrome using Selenium/Helium.

Log screenshots + page info into agent memory.

ðŸ’¡ Use Case

This serves as a template for building AI agents that can control browsers, useful for tasks like information verification, automated research, or real-time data collection.
